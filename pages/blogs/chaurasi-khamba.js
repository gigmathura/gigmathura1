                                <p>
                                    The temple is steeped in legend and lore, believed to date back to the era of Lord Krishna.
                                    It is said that Gokul was the home of Lord Krishna during his early childhood, and the Chaurasi Khamba Mandir stands as a testament
                                    to the deep spiritual history of the region. The temple&apos;s pillars are symbolic, representing various elements of Hindu cosmology and divine narratives.
                                    Over centuries, the temple has been a focal point for devotees seeking peace and blessings.

                                <p>
                                    As its name suggests, the Chaurasi Khamba Mandir boasts 84 beautifully sculpted stone pillars, each adorned with intricate carvings
                                    depicting scenes from Hindu mythology. The symmetry and craftsmanship reflect the ingenuity of ancient Indian architects.
                                    The temple&apos;s sanctum sanctorum houses a divine idol, creating a serene ambiance for visitors.
                                    The murals and decorative motifs across the temple&apos;s interior further enhance its visual and spiritual appeal.

                                <h2>Mystery of 84 Khamba Mandir </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Kaman is ruled by the number 84. There are 84 ponds, 84 temples and 84 hectares of land that is divided into 84 small pools of water.
                                    Located to the west of Kaman township in Bharatpur district is the Chaurasi Khamba temple (84 pillared temple). There is no idol worship, or for that matter, worship of any kind, performed at this site; yet, it is called a temple. Chaurasi Khamba is an ancient monument having 84 intricately carved pillars, but none has been able to count the exact number yet! Every time a curious visitor has attempted to count the pillars of the temple, the total number has either receded or exceeded the exact number. For this reason, Chaurashi Khamba is considered spooky.
                                    Legend also states that Lord Krishna had lived for a brief span in this monument during his childhood. Even the Pandava brothers had spent some part of the term of their exile in the forests before the Mahabharata war. Additionally, the locals believed that there is a pond close by, named Dharam Kund where the deity of Justice, Yama, had tested Yudhisthiraâ€™s wisdom by assuming the form of a Yaksha.
                                    Some men also believe that in his lifetime, King Vikramaditya, held his court at Chaurasi Khamba, though it is hard to tell whether it is just heresy or true.
                                    So, if you think you are good with numbers, there is a worthy reason for you to visit Chaurasi Khamba in Kaman.
