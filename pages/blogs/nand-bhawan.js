                                Visiting Nand Bhavan in Braj is like revisiting the infancy of Lord Krishna. The opulence of Nand Bhawan can be judged by its sprawling vast complex. The premises are huge and few ascending stairs lead to its entrance. Nand Bhawan is wealthy in its manifestation. The wide open spaces around the palace bring the yester-world real to the eyes. There are fascinating rooms exclusively allotted to everyone including father Nand baba, mother Yashoda, mother Rohini, Shri Krishna, Baldev, Shri Radha and their allies. The residence is extensive as it had a kitchen, dining hall, restrooms, storerooms etc. The mythical place is wrapped up with stories from the spiritually significant era.

 
Besides splendid and spacious rooms, pilgrims here are allured by the red sandstone temple of Nand Maharaja. This magnificent 19th-century temple is the major attraction for pilgrims. The ceilings of the temple are flooded with beautiful paintings and the walls are decorated with the scenes from the spiritually significant era. The murals and paintings seem so real that they bring the episodic scenes back to life that were once played in this palace for real. The temple has the idols of the deities Nand baba, mother Yashoda, Shri Krishna, brother Balarama, beloved Shri Radha and other family members. The enshrined deities are worshipped by the locals daily with faith.
